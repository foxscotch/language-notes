# language-notes

These are the notes I've taken when learning a few languages in the past. Also
not in the past. Like as in, currently. See also:
[foxscotch/command-finder](https://github.com/foxscotch/command-finder).

I do it both to help commit the things I learn to memory, and to serve as a
quick reference if it's been a while since I've used a language. It's been
pretty helpful, so idk maybe it'll be helpful to someone else one day?

The languages included are:

- Python
- Lua
- C
- Java
- Haskell

They're all a couple of years old, except Elixir, which I'm currently working
with, but should generally still be accurate. I doubt much has changed about the
things that I actually took notes on. They just won't have notes on any features
that have been added since I took the notes.

By the way, I use http://patorjk.com/software/taag/ for the rad lil language
titles.
