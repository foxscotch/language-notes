# language-notes

These are the notes I've taken when learning a few languages in the past. Also not in the past. Like as in, currently.

I do it both to help commit the things I learn to memory, and to serve as a quick reference if it's been a while since
I've used a language. It's been pretty helpful, so idk maybe it'll be helpful to someone else one day?

The languages included are:
 - Python
 - Lua
 - C
 - Java
 - Haskell

They're all a couple of years old, except Haskell, which I'm currently working with, but should generally still be
accurate. I doubt much has changed about the things that I actually took notes on. They just won't have notes on any
features that have been added since I took the notes.

By the way, I use http://patorjk.com/software/taag/ for the rad lil language titles.
