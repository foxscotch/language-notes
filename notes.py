# Introduction
# 
# This is Python. A weird, curly-bracketless programming language. It's named after Monty Python, not the genre of snake.
# Syntax is pretty different, compared to most other languages. Whitespace is important for some reason.

# These are single-line comments. Everything after them is commented. They can be placed at the end of a line of code, without any problems, as you'll see later.

""" This is a multiline comment.
    Everything until you make a second set of three double quotation marks will be commented.
    I don't really like them, other than for commenting out blocks of code to be dealt with later.
"""

# variables require no declaration beforehand. also, I'm showing some data types
my_int = 7
my_float = 1.23
my_bool = True
my_string = "Hi!"

# changing a variable looks exactly the same as initially assigning one (could be confusing...?)
change = 12
change = 10 # "change" is now 10 instead of 12

# lists. that's right, arrays are called lists in Python. why??
weird_stuff = ["Nissan Cube", "eyelid tattoos", "Python"]
weird_stuff[1]                              # equates to "eyelid tattoos". btw, they're zero-indexed. in other words, list[0] is the first item in the list, list[1] is the second, etc.
weird_stuff[0:2]                            # slicing. includes "Nissan Cube" and "eyelid tattoos". the first index number is included, but not the second. I have no idea why
weird_stuff[2] = "hairless kitties"         # changes "Python" to "hairless kitties"
weird_stuff.append("mayonnaise")            # adds "mayonnaise" to the end of the list
weird_stuff.index("eyelid tattoos")         # returns the index (position) of "eyelid tattoos" which is super duper useful and convenient
weird_stuff.insert(0, "Ouya controllers")   # inserts "Ouya controllers" at index 0, moving everything else up one (so that "Nissan Cube" is now 1, and so on)
weird_stuff.sort()                          # sorts weird_stuff in alphanumeric order
weird_stuff.remove("Nissan Cube")           # removes "Nissan Cube" from the list
weird_stuff.pop("Ouya controllers")         # returns "Ouya controllers" and removes it from the list
# note: a value in a list can also be a list

# more about list slicing
# basically it works like this: [start:stop:step]
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
nums[0:5]       # includes the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
nums[0:10:2]    # third value determines the steps between chosen numbers. this one includes the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9
# the index "10" for the stopping point is fine as long as you aren't trying to access the tenth index of the list, since it doesn't exist
# some numbers in the brackets can be omitted if you want:
nums[5:]        # starts at five and stops at the end. includes 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10
nums[:3]        # starts at the beginning and stops at three (index three, not the 3 value). includes 1, 2, and 3
nums[2::2]      # starts at 2, ends at the end, taking steps of two. includes 3, 5, 7, and 9
nums[::3]       # starts at beginning, ends at end, taking steps of three. includes 1, 4, 7, and 10
# negative step values can be used to reverse the list
nums[::-1]      # simply a reversed version of the list. includes 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 in that order
nums[7:2:-2]    # starts at seven, ends at two, taking BACKWARDS steps of 2. includes 8, 6, and 4 in that order

# join function. kinda related to lists, but a little odd
a_list = ["hyphenate", "this", "list"]
print "-".join(a_list) # prints "hyphenate-this-list". see what I mean by odd? despite it seeming like it operates on the list, it's a method of a string object

# dictionaries. they're like lists, but with keys that you define instead of using simple number indexes. similar to PHP's associative arrays
dict = {"Color": "Blue", "Size": 7, 12: "Hey"}
dict["Color"]   # equates to "Blue". it's important to note that they're still accessed with regular brackets
dict["Size"]    # equates to 7
dict[12]        # equates to "Hey"
# a value in a dictionary can be a list, too

# dictionaries can also be formatted in a more reading-friendly way
alice = {
    "name":     "Alice",
    "homework": [100.0, 92.0, 98.0, 100.0],
    "quizzes":  [82.0, 83.0, 91.0],
    "tests":    [89.0, 97.0]
}

# some dictionary functions
example = {
    "Key": "Value",
    "Quantity": 12
}
example.items()     # result is an array of tuples for key-value pairs:   [('Key', 'Value'), ('Quantity', 12)]
example.keys()      # result is an array of the keys in the dictionary:   ['Key', 'Quantity']
example.values()    # result is an array of the values in the dictionary: ['Value', 12]

# in the last section, I shortly mentioned tuples
# they are like lists, but immutable, meaning they can not be changed (but they CAN be deleted)
a_tuple = ("Can't change this", 123)

# delete stuff. I wouldn't suggest using it for entire variables, though. just overwrite the variable if you want to get rid of it for some reason
x = [1, 2, 3]
del x[1]  # deletes only the 2 value
del x     # deletes the entire x list (also will work for other kinds variables)

# simple math operators
addition = 72 + 23
subtraction = 108 - 204
multiplication = 108 * 0.5
division = 108 / 9          # important notes: int divided by int will be a floored int. int divided by float will be a float
exponentiation = 2 ** 3     # two to the power of three
modulo = 3 % 2              # remainder of 3 divided by 2 (1)

# you can straight-up get a single character from a string with the index thing. not sure if you can do this in other languages, never tried. it seems pretty useless anyway
fifth_letter = "monty"[4] # valued at "y"

# string functions
string = "Norway"
len(string)                                     # length of the word "Norway"
string.lower                                    # "norway"
string.upper                                    # "NORWAY"
num = 5.1
str(num)                                        # turns num into a string; "5.1"
new_string = "This is, absolutely, a sentence."
string_array = new_string.split()               # splits a string into an array by its words. resulting array is ["This", "is,", "absolutely,", "a", "sentence."]
new_string_array = new_string.split(",")        # argument specifies a delimiter. resulting array is ["This is", "absolutely", "a sentence."]
# P.S. the methods only work on strings (e.g. .lower and .upper) but the functions will work on other data types (e.g. len() and str() )

# print is Python's console.log()
print "Hello world!"                                                # prints "Hello World!" without quotes to the console
print "Welcome " + "to" + "Earth."                                  # prints "Welcome toEarth" (the typo-esque lack of a space is on purpose, to show that it takes your input rather literally)
print "Beep boop I am a robot. Here is my favorite number: " + 13   # gives an error. you can't combine a string and a number together (although printing a number alone is fine). use str()
print "Then again, it might be this: ", 6                           # ignore the second part of that last comment, you just can't ADD a number and a string. this is how you can attach something

# a neat print thing. separated from the others because it involves more than one line
print "Hi",
print "everyboty."
# prints "Hi everybody.". the added comma means the next print will be on the same line. the comma adds spaces though, for some reason (even when used for a single print command)

print(["Astroboy", "MechaGodzilla", "Liberty Prime"])

# sticking variables in console output. better alternative to using str() on a number for print
first_name = Jeff
last_name = Jefferson
print "Hi, %s %s." % (first_name, last_name) #prints "Hi, Jeff Jefferson." note: parentheses in last part are required even when there's only one variable

# user input in the console
name = raw_input("What's your name?") # prompts the user for their name, and puts the answer in the "name" variable

#
# File I/O
#

# open function lets you open files
file = open("file.txt", "r+")       # the second argument ("r+" in this example) decides whether to read, write, or both. "w" is write, "r" is read, and "r+" is read/write
# (variable name is unimportant)    # furthermore, the "a" argument is "append" mode, which will let you add stuff after the current contents of the file
                                    # using "w" or "a" modes, you can make a new file; with the other modes, you can't (how could you read a file that doesn't exist?)
# writing to the file
file.write("Hi")                    # writes "Hi" to the file
for x in range(1,11):
    file.write(str(x) + "\n")       # writes the numbers 1 through 10, each on a new line (\n means "new line", e.g. "Hi \n there" will write "Hi" on one line, and "there" on the next)

# so you know what we're looking at, here's the file's current contents:
# 
#   Hi1
#   2
#   3
#   4
#   5
#   6
#   7
#   8
#   9
#   10

# reading the file
print file.read()                   # prints the contents of the file. in this case, it's "Hi1" on the first line, then 2-10 on the following lines

# just reading one line at a time
print file.readline()               # prints "Hi1". you can specify a number as the argument, but it only affects how many characters of the line it reads
print file.readline()               # prints "2"

# gotta close the file
file.close()                        # closing the file is necessary. if you don't do it, it won't save your changes
                                    # according to Codecademy, that isn't the only issue, but it's being unclear about any other problems...

# wanna check whether or not it's really closed?
print file.closed                   # "closed" is a property of all file objects; this particular one will print "True" because the file IS closed

# additional notes:
# you can open the same file more than once at a time, if you want (such as reading it and writing to it, with two different instances), but I don't see why you would need to, really
# naturally, you can also have two different files open at a time (such as reading information from one and writing it to another), which I can see the use of

# and       "              "    (e.g. True and True is True)
# or        "              "    (e.g. True or False is True)

float(5)        # converts an int to a float. result is equal to 5.0

# for loops. for loops are NOT like JavaScript's for loops. rather, they're like its foreach loops. there is nothing similar to JS for loops
list = [1, 3, 5]
for placeholder in list:
    print placeholder # prints 1, then 3, then 5, each on separate lines
# more info: for every object in "list", it does the stuff that comes after the "for" statement, with "placeholder" being a placeholder for the current object
# when used with a dictionary, the placeholder will stand for the key, not the value

# break keyword. only works with loops (both for and while)
list = [0, 1, 2]
for i in list:
    if i == 1:
        break
    else:
        print i
# the loop will end when it reaches 1

# range() can be used to make fake JavaScript for loops. the function is used as a shortcut for creating simple lists without declaring a variable
range(5)            # creates [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
range(1, 4)         # creates [1, 2, 3] (just like the the string/list-slicing thing, the first number is included, but not the second)
range(1, 11, 2)     # creates [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
# three "versions" of it:
# range(stop)
# range(start, stop)
# range(start, stop, step)

# example of using range() for a loop
for i in range(5)
    print "Hi"
# it will print "Hi" five times

# while loops. uses conditions, like the ones used in if statements. be careful of infinite loops
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print "Hi"
    count += 1  # this adds 1 to count. just a quicker way of saying "count = count + 1"
# like the last for loop, this prints "Hi" five times. neither method is a perfect replacement for JS for loops, but there's no other choice

# while/else. it's a weird thing... but I guess useful. the else part will always execute at the end of the loop
count = 1
while count == 1:
    print count
else:
    print "Done."
# this will print 1, and then "Done." pls note that the else statement is part of the loop. therefore if a break is used, the else part will NOT run

# list comprehension. syntax is similar to for loops with if statements. super cool stuff, with lots of possible uses
even_numbers = [x for x in range(1, 11) if x % 2 == 0]      # simple example. just makes a list of the even numbers from 1 to 10

# lambda. creates a fake ("anonymous") function, for passing into another function, or whatever. kind of interesting, I guess, but I think I'd just make a real function
lambda x: x % 3 == 0
# ^^that is basically the same as this:
def by_three(x):
    return x % 3 == 0
# not going into much detail because I honestly don't see the point of these, they're just confusing

# you can tell Python how to show off objects of your class, such as when using print, by defining a __repr__() function

# this is a small section, but big enough to justify it being separate. it's only about bitwise operations
# if you need an explanation of bits or binary numbers, google it. that's kinda out of the scope of this file

# straight-up binary numbers. the prefix 0b means the following number will be in binary form
print 0b1       # prints 1
print 0b00101   # prints 5. as shown, the number can be prefaced by zeros if you want. that could help with organization
print 0b11111   # prints 31
# the numbers are considered by Python to simply be integers. nice and simple. but it does mean you shouldn't do bitwise operations on floats

# bin function. doesn't do any real converting; just returns a STRING (that is important) version of the integer you pass into it, in binary form
print bin(12) # prints "0b1100"
# hex and oct functions also exist, with analogous uses

# int function has a second argument. when an integer is passed after the string, that is used to represent the base the number is in (binary is base 2)
int("101", 2) # returns 5

# bitwise operators. these are very unlike logical operators, and have entirely different practical uses
# <<    left bit shift      Moves the number's bits left.
# >>    right bit shift     Moves the number's bits right.
# &     AND                 Compares two numbers and returns a number with bits turned on that correspond to places in the original numbers where both numbers were 1.
# |     OR                  Similar to AND, but the bit is 1 where EITHER of the original numbers contained 1.
# ^     XOR                 Exclusive OR; resulting bits are 1 where the original bits were not the same.
# ~     NOT                 "Flips all the bits in a single number." Codecademy isn't explaining exactly what this means, so I guess that will have to be enough for now.

# more about the shift operators
0b01 << 2 # result is 0b100
0b10 >> 1 # result is 0b001
0b10 >> 2 # result is 0b000. as you can see, it literally just moves them left or right

# AND operator
a       = 0b1010
b       = 0b0011
a & b  == 0b0010
#             ^  that is the only bit where the value was 1 in both; therefore it's also the only bit that is 1 in the new number

# OR operator
a       = 0b1010
